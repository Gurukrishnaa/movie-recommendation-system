# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
The **Movie Recommendation System** is a **Flask-based web application** that provides personalized movie recommendations using **collaborative filtering techniques**. The system supports both **user-based** and **item-based collaborative filtering** and presents recommendations through an intuitive web interface.

---

## Features
- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests movies based on the preferences of similar users.
- **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies that are similar to those the user has already liked.
- **Handling Sparsity**: Uses **imputation techniques** to manage missing data in the user-item interaction matrix.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Built with **Flask** and **Bootstrap** for a modern and responsive UI.
- **Movie Posters Integration**: Fetches and displays movie posters from the **TMDb API** (optional).

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Scipy
- Requests (optional, for TMDb API integration)

### Steps to Run the Project
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd movie-recommendation-system
   ```
3. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Download the MovieLens Dataset**:
   - Place `ratings.csv` and `movies.csv` in the project directory.

5. **Run the Flask Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
6. **Access the Application**:
   Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## How It Works
### 1. User-Based Collaborative Filtering
- Identifies users with similar movie preferences.
- Recommends movies that similar users have highly rated but the target user has not seen.

### 2. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
- Identifies movies that are similar to those the user has previously liked.
- Recommends movies with characteristics closely matching the user‚Äôs interests.

### 3. Handling Sparsity
- Fills missing values in the user-item interaction matrix using the average rating of each user.
- Ensures accurate similarity calculations.
